If Card suits symbols are showing up as "?".  In the Launch Configuration dialog, choose the output encoding in the Common tab and choose UTF-8.

Note-There are more details about the game as comments throughout the code.

A Poker Game designed with swing.

PokerGame Class
Is the game itself, provides the JFrame as well as stores the players, and allowedPlayers. Keeps track of the money,
think about it as the table itself. I also use this class to save data and read the data.

Card Class
A Card is represented by 2 Enums, one for the suits and another for the ranks. 

Deck Class
Was implemented as a singleton, since i need the deck to stay in memory. The Deck creates the 52 Card objects and then shuffles them.

Ranking Class
Used entirely for ranking the hand of each player, it provides an enum for the type of hand such as one pair, two pairs etc,
and it also provides an integer to represent the value of the high card in case of a tie. The enum type and the integer are both stored
in a Player map variable called handValue.

Player Class
int currentBet-Keeps track of how much money each player has bet in that round. When someone raises and the player wants to call again,
i get the difference from the raise to the currentBet.
boolean turn-is used to keep track if the players needs a turn, or if someone has raised, then they get another turn.

MenuPane, AddPanel, RemovePanel, PlayerPanel Classes
Implemented each different menu option and the menu itself as its own class, to make the code more readable.

PlayPanel Class
Is where the actual turns happen. It starts with an ante where it gets money from each player, then a switchCards turn where each player is
allowed to switch cards. Then we get into the call/raise/fold turn. When a player folds they automatically gets removed from the
allowedPlayers array. I keep track of which Player needs a turn by a boolean variable inside of the Player. When a Player raises,
all the other Players turn changes to false, so we can iterate though each player once again.
